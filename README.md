# Arch Customization by fflopsi

Some files to customize an Arch Linux / EndeavourOS installation to my liking

## Usage

To apply all customizations, just run the script `customize-all.sh` located in the root directory of this repository.

To only apply certain customizations, you can also run single scripts located in the different sub-directories.
